# Microwave Programming Language

Microwave is a simple, esoteric programming language designed for fun and learning. It features a minimalistic syntax and a set of commands inspired by the behavior of a microwave oven.

## Introduction

Microwave is a quirky and unconventional programming language that mimics the functionality of a microwave oven. It was created with the intention of being a fun and educational tool to explore programming concepts in a unique way.

In Microwave, programs are written using a set of simple commands that correspond to common actions performed on a microwave oven, such as heating, setting timers, and checking the status.

## Getting Started

To start programming in Microwave, you don't need any special setup or installation. Simply create a text file with a `.mw` extension and start writing Microwave code using your favorite text editor.

Once you've written your Microwave program, you can run it using a Microwave interpreter or compiler. There are currently interpreters and compilers available for various platforms.

## Language Basics

### Commands

Microwave programs consist of a series of commands, each of which corresponds to a specific action. Here are the available commands in Microwave:

- `mmm`: Start cooking.
- `mMm`: Increase power level.
- `mmM`: Decrease power level.
- `mMM`: Pause cooking.
- `Mmm`: Open the door.
- `MMm`: Close the door.
- `MmM`: Set timer.
- `MMM`: Check timer status.
- `beep`: Emit a beep sound.
- `Beep`: Emit multiple beep sounds.
- `beeP`: Pause cooking and prompt for user input.
- `BEEP`: Print the timer countdown.

### Memory Manipulation

Microwave programs can manipulate memory using the following commands:

- `mMm`: Move memory pointer to the left.
- `mmM`: Move memory pointer to the right.
- `MMM`: Reset memory block to 0.

### Input and Output

Microwave programs can interact with the user through input and output commands:

- `Mmm`: Read a character from the input (door open) and store it in memory.
- `beeP`: Prompt the user for input (pause cooking) and store it in memory.
- `BEEP`: Print the timer countdown to the output (display).

### Flow Control

Microwave programs can control the flow of execution using the following commands:

- `mmm` and `MMM`: Allow for conditional execution based on the timer status.
- `mMM`: Pause cooking and resume from the previous pause point.

## Examples

Here are a few examples to get you started with programming in Microwave:

```mw
mmm mMM MmM
